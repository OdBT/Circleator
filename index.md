# Circleator

## Overview

The Charm City Circleator--or Circleator for short--is a Perl-based
visualization tool developed at the [Institute for Genome Sciences][igs]
in the University of Maryland's School of Medicine. Circleator produces
circular plots of genome-associated data, like this one:

Common uses of the tool include:

* Displaying the sequence and/or genes in a [GenBank][] flat file.
* Highlighting differences and/or similarities in gene content between related organisms.
* Comparing SNPs and indels between closely-related strains or serovars.
* Comparing gene expression values across multiple samples or timepoints.
* Visualizing coverage plots of RNA-Seq read alignments.
