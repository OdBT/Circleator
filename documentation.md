## Tutorials

The following tutorials (which will be posted here shortly) will provide detailed walkthroughs for common use-cases:

 * Visualizing gene annotation and DNA sequence data from a GenBank flat file.
 * Investigating patterns of gene conservation in two or more closely-related strains or serovars.
 * Showing SNPs and/or indels in several microbial strains relative to a reference genome and gene set.
 * Viewing coverage plots of RNA-Seq data from multiple transcriptomic samples.
 * Displaying quantitative data using graphs and heat maps.

## Additional Resources
