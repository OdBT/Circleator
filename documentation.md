separate project/repository ("Ringmaster").

A selection of detailed tutorials for common data types and figure formats:

 * [GenBank Flat File Visualization][gb_annotation] - display the sequence and/or annotation from a GenBank flat file
 * Gene conservation _(coming soon)_ - visualize patterns of gene conservation in two or more closely-related strains or serovars.
 * SNPs and indels _(coming soon)_ - show SNPs and/or indels in several microbial strains relative to a reference genome and gene set.
 * RNA-Seq coverage plots _(coming soon)_ - view coverage plots of RNA-Seq data.
 * Graphs and heat maps _(coming soon)_ - display quantitative data using graphs and heat maps.
