# Circleator - Documentation

## Installation

Please see the [Installation Guide][install] for detailed download 
and installation instructions.

[install]: {{site.baseurl}}/install.html

## Running Circleator

The current release of Circleator only provides a command-line
interface, documented below:

 * [Circleator command line usage][cmdline]

A prototype ExtJS web interface has been developed and split off into a 
separate project/repository ("Ringmaster").

## Tutorials

A selection of detailed tutorials for common data types and figure formats:

 * [GenBank Flat File Visualization][gb_annotation] - display the sequence and/or annotation from a GenBank flat file
 * [Coverage Plots Using BAM Files][coverage_plots] - view coverage plots of RNA-Seq and other types of BAM-encoded alignment data.
 * [Gene Conservation Visualization][gene_conservation] - visualize patterns of gene conservation in two or more closely-related strains or serovars.

Work is still ongoing for the following tutorials. If you're interested in more information on 
displaying these datatypes, get in touch with us via e-mail or the [Circleator Google group][ggroup]:

 * SNPs and indels - show SNPs and/or indels in several microbial strains relative to a reference genome and gene set.
 * Graphs and heat maps - ways to display quantitative data using graphs and heat maps.
